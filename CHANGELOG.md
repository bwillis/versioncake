## 2.0.0 (Feb 6, 2014)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/bwillis/versioncake/compare/v1.3...v2.0)

Bug Fixes:

* Adjusting view details priorities so that RABL templates that do not have a format are not prioritized over templates that do have a format (issues #14). This is going to go into v2 as it is a breaking change.
* Looking up a versioned or unversioned layout template was not working (issue #22). The change related to issue #14 resulted in the template format not being identified properly. Monkey patched another Rails (for old and new Rails) method to fix this issue.

Enhancements:

* New path strategy to support `/v3/posts` style versioning, thanks [Michael Elfassy](https://github.com/elfassy)
* Support Rails 4.1, thanks [Washington L Braga Jr](https://github.com/huoxito)
* Added v1->v2 template renaming migration script
* Improving configuration
